    "text": "Discussion of business associates can be found at http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/hipaa/understanding/coveredentities/businessassociates.html 5 Guidance on De-identification of Protected Health Information November 26, 2012. The Privacy Rule was designed to protect individually identifiable health information through permitting only certain uses and disclosures of PHI provided by the Rule, or as authorized by the individual subject of the information. However, in recognition of the potential utility of health information even when it is not individually identifiable, §164.502(d) of the Privacy Rule permits a covered entity or its business associate to create information that is not individually identifiable by following the de-identification standard and implementation specifications in §164.514(a)-(b). These provisions allow the entity to use and disclose information that neither identifies nor provides a reasonable basis to identify an individual.4 As discussed below, the Privacy Rule provides two de-identification methods: 1) a formal determination by a qualified expert; or 2) the removal of specified individual identifiers as well as absence of actual knowledge by the covered entity that the remaining information could be used alone or in combination with other information to identify the individual.",

The computation of population uniques can be achieved in numerous ways, such as through the approaches outlined in published literature.14,15 For instance, if an expert is attempting to assess if the combination of a patient‘s race, age, and geographic region of residence is unique, the expert may use population statistics published by the U.S. Census Bureau to assist in this estimation. In instances when population statistics are unavailable or unknown, the expert may calculate and rely on the statistics derived from the data set. This is because a record can only be linked between the data set and the population to which it is being compared if it is unique in both.",

For example, it does not apply to a request by a health care provider for treatment purposes – the entire record may be requested or disclosed in that circumstance.",
